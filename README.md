## Single Page Application with React.js

**Lineup** is an app that connects surfers all over the world. Just sign-up and see all the upcoming surf sessions and other activities in your area. Simply join one, or create your own session. And if there are no waves, don't worry: Just initiate another activity, like board and wet suit repairs, going for coffee or watching surf movies together. A great way to make some new friends with like-minded people who whare the same deep passion for surfing like you do.
